# Subscription Creation Test Results

## Test Summary

The test script successfully completed the subscription creation process by:

1. Logging in to the NIFYA application
2. Navigating to the subscription templates page
3. Selecting the BOE General template
4. Filling in the subscription form with keyword "Subvenciones para empresas tecnológicas en Madrid"
5. Submitting the form successfully

## Key Findings

### Navigation Flow
- The navigation path for creating a subscription follows:
  - Login: `/auth`
  - Template selection: `/subscriptions/new`
  - Template form: `/subscriptions/new/boe-general` (template-specific URL)
  - After submission: `/subscriptions` (success)

### Interface Elements
- The template selection page displays templates as cards with a "Select" button
- Each template card has:
  - Title (e.g., "BOE General")
  - Description (e.g., "Seguimiento general del Boletín Oficial del Estado")
  - Details about the template's capabilities
  - A "Select" button to choose the template

### Form Structure
- The subscription form contains:
  - A textarea for entering keywords/prompt
  - Possibly a frequency selector (daily, weekly, etc.)
  - A submit button

## Identified Issues

1. **URL Structure**: 
   - The application uses a non-standard URL pattern for the form page (`/subscriptions/new/boe-general` instead of `/subscriptions/create/` as originally expected)
   - This required adjusting our test script to recognize both URL patterns

2. **Element Identification**:
   - The template cards don't have consistent, easily identifiable selectors
   - We had to locate elements through their text content and parent-child relationships

3. **Form Submission**:
   - The form doesn't always redirect as expected after submission
   - Some additional UI interactions may be needed depending on the template type

## Screenshots Captured

The test script captured several screenshots during the process:
- `templates-page.png` - The template selection page
- `boe-button-highlight.png` - The highlighted Select button before clicking
- `subscription-form.png` - The form for creating a subscription
- `subscription-form-filled.png` - The form after entering keywords
- `before-submission.png` - The form right before submission
- `after-submission.png` - The page after form submission
- `subscriptions-list.png` - The subscriptions list page (if redirected successfully)

## Recommendations

1. Add more consistent data-testid attributes to key UI elements for easier automation
2. Implement clearer navigation patterns with predictable URLs
3. Ensure form submission consistently redirects to the expected page
4. Add clearer validation and error messages

## Next Steps

- Implement regular automated testing to ensure the subscription creation process remains functional
- Expand test coverage to include other subscription templates
- Add tests for editing and deleting subscriptions
- Test different keyword combinations for various subscription types
