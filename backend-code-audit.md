# Backend Code Audit: Duplications and Improvement Areas

## Subscription-Related Code Duplication

During the implementation of subscription management features, we identified several areas of code duplication and potential improvements in the backend code:

### 1. Route Duplications

The subscription routes are defined in multiple places:

- `/backend/src/interfaces/http/routes/subscription.routes.js` (main route file)
- `/backend/src/interfaces/http/routes/subscription/crud.routes.js` (dedicated CRUD operations)
- `/backend/src/interfaces/http/routes/subscription/process.routes.js` (processing routes)
- `/backend/src/interfaces/http/routes/subscription/sharing.routes.js` (sharing routes)

**Recommendation:** Consolidate all subscription routes under the `/subscription` directory and use the main `subscription.routes.js` file only to import and register these routes.

### 2. Endpoint Duplications

Several endpoints are defined in multiple places:

- The DELETE `/subscriptions/:id` endpoint exists in both:
  - `subscription.routes.js` (lines 450-502)
  - `subscription/crud.routes.js` (lines 373-449)

- The POST `/subscriptions/:id/process` endpoint exists in both:
  - `subscription.routes.js` (lines 394-448)
  - `subscription/process.routes.js` (lines 17-196)

**Recommendation:** Remove duplicate endpoints and maintain a single source of truth for each API endpoint.

### 3. Service Layer Duplication

The subscription service logic (`subscription.service.js`) has several methods that perform similar operations:

- `createSubscription` and `createSubscriptionFromTemplate` have significant overlap
- `updateSubscription` and `updateSubscriptionFields` do similar things with different parameter structures
- Various validation functions are scattered throughout the service

**Recommendation:** Refactor to create shared utility functions for common operations and validation logic.

### 4. Database Access Patterns

The service layer sometimes bypasses the repository layer and accesses the database directly:

- Direct Supabase queries in service methods instead of using repository methods
- Mixing of query approach (PostgreSQL) and ORM-like approaches

**Recommendation:** Ensure consistent use of the repository pattern. All database operations should go through repository methods.

### 5. Error Handling Inconsistencies

Error handling is inconsistent across the subscription endpoints:

- Some routes use the ErrorResponseBuilder
- Others use manual error objects
- Some catch blocks have detailed error handling, others simply pass through errors

**Recommendation:** Standardize error handling using the ErrorResponseBuilder across all endpoints.

### 6. Validation Approaches

Multiple validation approaches are used:

- Manual validation with custom logic
- Schema-based validation
- Database constraints

**Recommendation:** Adopt a consistent validation approach, preferably using schema validation with a library like Joi or Zod.

## Authentication Service Improvement Areas

The authentication service has a more consistent implementation but could benefit from:

1. Better separation of JWT creation/verification from business logic
2. More robust refresh token handling
3. Structured logging for authentication events

## Other Backend Duplications

1. Multiple implementations of database clients and connections
2. Redundant API documentation code across routes
3. Duplicate logging utilities and configurations

## Next Steps

1. Consolidate route files to remove endpoint duplication
2. Refactor service layer to reduce function duplication
3. Standardize error handling and validation
4. Implement consistent repository pattern use
5. Improve test coverage for refactored code
