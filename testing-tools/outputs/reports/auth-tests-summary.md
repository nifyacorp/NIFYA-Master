# Authentication Service Test Results

## Test Results Summary

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Login | ✅ PASS | Successfully authenticates and retrieves tokens |
| Get Profile | ✅ PASS | Successfully retrieves user profile information |
| Get Session | ❌ FAIL | Endpoint `/api/auth/sessions` not found (404) |
| Refresh Token | ✅ PASS | Successfully refreshes access and refresh tokens |
| Revoke All Sessions | ✅ PASS | Successfully revokes all active sessions |

**Overall Success Rate:** 80% (4/5 tests passing)

## Authentication Service Health Status

### ⚠️ GOOD (80.00%)
The authentication system is working but has some minor issues that should be addressed soon.

## Key Findings

1. **Working Capabilities:**
   - User authentication with email/password
   - Access and refresh token issuance
   - User profile retrieval
   - Token refresh
   - Session revocation

2. **Issues Detected:**
   - The session retrieval endpoint is missing or incorrectly implemented
   - Endpoint path `/api/auth/sessions` returns 404 Not Found

## API Response Schemas

### Login Response Schema

```json
{
  "accessToken": "string",
  "refreshToken": "string",
  "user": {
    "id": "string",
    "name": "string",
    "email": "string",
    "emailVerified": "boolean",
    "createdAt": "string",
    "updatedAt": "string"
  }
}
```

### User Profile Schema

```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "email": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "emailVerified": "boolean",
  "createdAt": "string",
  "updatedAt": "string"
}
```

## Recommendations

1. **High Priority:**
   - Implement the session retrieval endpoint at `/api/auth/sessions`
   - Ensure session management endpoints use consistent naming

2. **Documentation Improvements:**
   - Update API documentation to reflect actual implemented endpoints
   - Document token refresh and session management flows

3. **Testing Enhancements:**
   - Add tests for password change functionality
   - Add tests for email verification
   - Add tests for OAuth authentication (Google)

## Next Steps

1. Implement the missing session endpoint
2. Update auth test configuration in `endpoints.js` if the correct path is different
3. Expand tests to cover additional authentication endpoints (password operations, OAuth)
4. Integrate authentication tests with the comprehensive test suite
