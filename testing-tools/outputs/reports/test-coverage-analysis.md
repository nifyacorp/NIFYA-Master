**Notes**:
- The `/subscriptions/debug-filter` endpoint returns 404 errors, indicating it's not implemented in the backend yet
- The subscription type creation endpoint test was implemented but is failing
- Extended tests for the debug-filter endpoint were added but also failing
- Basic subscription endpoints are working properly

### User Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Covered | Test File | Status |
|----------|--------|---------|-----------|--------|
| `/me` | GET | ✅ | tests/user/user-profile-tests.js | Implemented |

| `/me/email-preferences` | GET | ✅ | tests/user/user-profile-tests.js | Implemented |
| `/me/email-preferences` | PATCH | ✅ | tests/user/user-profile-tests.js | Implemented |
| `/me/test-email` | POST | ✅ | tests/user/user-profile-tests.js | Implemented |
| `/notifications/mark-sent` | POST | ❌ | Not Covered | Not Implemented |

**Notes**:
- All core user profile endpoints are tested
- The administrative endpoint for marking notifications as sent via email is not tested

### Template Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Covered | Test File | Status |
|----------|--------|---------|-----------|--------|
| `/templates` | GET | ✅ | tests/subscriptions/templates.js | Passing |
| `/templates/:id` | GET | ✅ | tests/templates/template-details.js | Passing |
| `/templates` | POST | ✅ | tests/templates/create-template.js | Failing |
| `/templates/:id/subscribe` | POST | ✅ | tests/templates/subscribe-from-template.js | Failing |

**Notes**:
- Template listing and detail endpoints are working correctly
- Template creation and subscription from template tests were implemented but are failing

### API Explorer and Diagnostics Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Covered | Test File | Status |
|----------|--------|---------|-----------|--------|
| `/health` | GET | ✅ | tests/health/health.js | Passing |
| `/explorer` | GET | ✅ | tests/explorer/api-explorer.js | Failing |
| `/explorer/:path` | GET | ✅ | tests/explorer/api-explorer.js | Not Tested |
| Various debug endpoints | Various | ✅ | tests/admin/diagnose-database.js | Passing |

**Notes**:
- Basic health checks are functioning correctly
- API explorer endpoint test was implemented but is failing
- Diagnostic endpoints are working properly

## Test Suites

We now have comprehensive test suites to cover all endpoint categories:

1. **Notification Tests**: `run-notification-tests.js`
   - Tests notification retrieval, filtering, marking as read, activity, statistics

2. **Subscription Tests**: `run-subscription-tests.js`
   - Tests subscription creation, listing, updating, processing, sharing
   - Includes the debug-filter endpoint tests

3. **Template Tests**: `run-template-tests.js`
   - Tests template listing, details, creation, and subscription from template

4. **Explorer Tests**: `run-explorer-tests.js`
   - Tests API documentation endpoints

5. **User Profile Tests**: `run-user-profile-tests.js`
   - Tests user profile management, notification settings, email preferences

6. **Comprehensive Tests**: `run-all-tests.js`
   - Runs all the individual test suites
   - Generates consolidated reports

## Current Issues

1. **Debug Filter Endpoint**: The new `/subscriptions/debug-filter` endpoint returns 404 errors, indicating it's not implemented in the backend yet.

2. **Template Management**: Template creation and subscription from template endpoints are not working correctly, returning errors.

3. **API Explorer**: The API explorer endpoints are not functioning properly.

4. **Notification List Endpoint**: The main notification listing endpoint is failing, which is a critical issue.

## Recommendations

1. **Backend Implementation**: The backend team should implement the missing endpoints, particularly the debug-filter endpoint which was identified as important for debugging.

2. **API Version Compatibility**: Ensure API client implementations match the expected request formats for the backend endpoints, especially for template and subscription operations.

3. **Error Handling**: Improve error reporting and handling in tests to better diagnose issues.

4. **Authentication Improvements**: Some tests may be failing due to authentication issues; review token handling and user ID management.

5. **Critical Endpoint Prioritization**: Fix the critical failing endpoints first, particularly the notification listing endpoint.

## Conclusion

The NIFYA Backend API has improved test coverage with approximately 95% of documented endpoints now covered by tests. However, several implemented tests are failing, indicating issues with the backend implementation or API compatibility.

The latest test run shows a 56% success rate (10/18 tests passing), which needs improvement. The failing tests provide valuable information to guide backend fixes and improvements.
