# NIFYA Platform Testing Report

## Test Summary

| Test Category | Status | Issues |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| Authentication | ✅ PASS | None |
| Subscriptions | ❌ FAIL | Database schema error |
| Notifications | ⚠️ PARTIAL | No notifications found |
| User Journey | ❌ FAIL | Subscription creation error |

## Authentication Service

The authentication service is functioning correctly. Tests were able to:
- Successfully authenticate using valid credentials
- Receive a valid JWT token
- Extract user ID from the token

**Testing Notes**:
- Response time is good (~0.5s)
- Token includes all expected claims (sub, email, name, type)
- Proper token expiration is set

## Backend Service - Subscriptions

The subscription service is returning errors when attempting to create new subscriptions.

**Critical Issue**:
- Database schema error: `column "logo" of relation "subscriptions" does not exist`
- This indicates a mismatch between the application code and database schema
- The backend is likely trying to insert a "logo" field that doesn't exist in the database

**Testing Notes**:
- GET `/api/v1/subscriptions` works correctly (returns empty array)
- POST `/api/v1/subscriptions` fails with 500 error
- Templates endpoint fails with 500 error

## Backend Service - Notifications

The notifications API is functioning correctly but no notifications were found.

**Testing Notes**:
- GET `/api/v1/notifications` returns expected structure
- No notifications were found after multiple polling attempts
- This is expected since subscription creation is failing

## User Journey

The end-to-end user journey fails at the subscription creation step.

**Testing Notes**:
- Authentication completes successfully
- Subscription creation fails with database error

## Recommendation

1. **Fix Database Schema**:
   - Add the missing "logo" column to the "subscriptions" table
   - SQL might look like: `ALTER TABLE subscriptions ADD COLUMN logo TEXT;`

2. **Check for Other Schema Mismatches**:
   - Run a database schema validation against application models
   - Check recent migrations for incomplete/incorrect changes

3. **Implement Better Error Handling**:
   - Add proper validation before database operations
   - Provide more descriptive errors for frontend developers

## API Structure Summary

### Authentication Service
- Login: POST `/api/auth/login` ✅
- User Profile: GET `/api/auth/me` ✅

### Subscription Service
- List: GET `/api/v1/subscriptions` ✅
- Create: POST `/api/v1/subscriptions` ❌
- Templates: GET `/api/v1/templates` ❌
- Process: POST `/api/v1/subscriptions/:id/process` ⚠️ (Not tested due to creation error)

### Notification Service
- List: GET `/api/v1/notifications` ✅
- Filter by Subscription: GET `/api/v1/notifications?subscriptionId=:id` ✅

## Next Steps

1. Apply the database fix for the missing "logo" column
2. Rerun the tests to verify subscription creation works
3. Test the subscription processing functionality 
4. Verify notifications are being generated properly
