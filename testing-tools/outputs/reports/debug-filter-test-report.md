# Debug Filter Endpoint Test Report

**Test Date:** April 4, 2025  
**Backend Version:** Latest Update with Debug Filter Endpoint  
**Test Environment:** Development

## Overview

This report documents the testing of the newly added `/api/v1/subscriptions/debug-filter` diagnostic endpoint, which was designed to help debug filter issues by exposing how query parameters are being parsed and interpreted.

## Test Setup

The test script (`debug-filter.js`) was created to test the endpoint with various query parameter combinations:

1. Basic call (no parameters)
2. Type filter (`type=boe`)
3. Status filter (`status=active`)
4. Date filter (`createdAfter=2025-01-01`)
5. Combined filters (`type=boe&status=active&limit=10`)

## Test Results

| Test Case | Parameters | Status Code | Response |
|-----------|------------|-------------|----------|
| Basic | None | 404 | `{"status":"error","code":"SUBSCRIPTION_NOT_FOUND","message":"Subscription not found"}` |
| Type Filter | `type=boe` | 404 | `{"status":"error","code":"SUBSCRIPTION_NOT_FOUND","message":"Subscription not found"}` |
| Status Filter | `status=active` | 404 | `{"status":"error","code":"SUBSCRIPTION_NOT_FOUND","message":"Subscription not found"}` |
| Date Filter | `createdAfter=2025-01-01` | 404 | `{"status":"error","code":"SUBSCRIPTION_NOT_FOUND","message":"Subscription not found"}` |
| Combined Filters | `type=boe&status=active&limit=10` | 404 | `{"status":"error","code":"SUBSCRIPTION_NOT_FOUND","message":"Subscription not found"}` |

## Analysis

The debug filter endpoint appears to be implemented but is returning a 404 "SUBSCRIPTION_NOT_FOUND" error for all test cases. This suggests:

1. **Incorrect Endpoint Implementation**: The endpoint might be attempting to find a specific subscription without having a subscription ID.

2. **Route Configuration Issue**: The endpoint might be misconfigured in the routing setup, redirecting to a detail endpoint that expects an ID.

3. **Incomplete Implementation**: The debug filter functionality may be partially implemented but not yet fully functional.

## Response Format

All responses followed the same format:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "code": "SUBSCRIPTION_NOT_FOUND",
  "message": "Subscription not found"
}
```

This is the same error format seen in other API endpoints when a specific subscription ID is not found, suggesting the debug endpoint might be inadvertently trying to find a subscription rather than debug filter parameters.

## Integration with Test Suite

The debug filter endpoint was added to:

1. The endpoints configuration file (`config/endpoints.js`)
2. The subscription management test suite (`subscription-manager-tests.js`)
3. The comprehensive test runner (`run-all-tests.js`)
4. A dedicated test file (`debug-filter.js`)

## Recommendations

1. **Review Endpoint Implementation**: The backend team should review the implementation of the debug filter endpoint. It appears the endpoint may be trying to find a specific subscription rather than debugging filter parameters.

2. **Update Route Handling**: Ensure the route is correctly configured to handle debugging of filter parameters rather than retrieving subscription data.

3. **Example Implementation**: A proper implementation should return the parsed query parameters, for example:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "parsedParams": {
      "type": "boe",
      "status": "active",
      "limit": 10
    },
    "sqlQuery": "SELECT * FROM subscriptions WHERE type = 'boe' AND status = 'active' LIMIT 10"
  }
}
```

4. **Documentation**: Once fixed, document the endpoint in the API documentation, explaining its purpose and expected responses.

## Conclusion

The newly added debug filter endpoint is currently not functioning as expected. It returns a subscription not found error for all test cases, suggesting an implementation issue. This endpoint should be revisited by the development team before it can be used effectively for debugging filter issues.
