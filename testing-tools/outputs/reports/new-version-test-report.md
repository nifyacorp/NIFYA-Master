# NIFYA New Version Testing Report

## Test Summary

| Test Category | Status | Issues |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| Authentication | ✅ PASS | None |
| Subscriptions Listing | ✅ PASS | None |
| Subscription Creation | ❌ FAIL | Database JSON syntax error |
| Template Listing | ❌ FAIL | Backend error (500) |
| Notifications | ❌ FAIL | Backend error (500) |

## Authentication Service

The authentication service is functioning correctly. Tests successfully:
- Authenticate using valid credentials
- Receive a valid JWT token
- Extract user ID from the token

## Backend Service - Subscriptions

### Working Features
- **Subscription Listing**: GET `/api/v1/subscriptions` works correctly, returns an empty array with proper pagination

### Issues
- **Subscription Creation**: The system is still returning errors when creating a subscription:
  - First there was a validation error requiring `frequency` field
  - After adding the frequency field, a database error occurs: `"Database operation failed: invalid input syntax for type json"`
  - This suggests there's an issue with how JSON data is being handled in the database

- **Template Listing**: Still fails with a 500 error:
  ```
  {
    "error": "TEMPLATE_FETCH_ERROR",
    "message": "Failed to fetch public templates",
    "status": 500
  }
  ```

## Backend Service - Notifications

Notifications API is now failing with a new error:

```
{
  "statusCode": 500,
  "error": "Internal Server Error",
  "message": "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'match')"
}
```

This appears to be a code error rather than a database schema issue, suggesting there's a null/undefined value being accessed in the code.

## Changes from Previous Version

Comparing with our previous testing results:

1. **Database Schema Issue**: The "missing column" error has been resolved, but now there's a JSON syntax error. This suggests:
   - The `logo` column has been added to the database
   - There may be an issue with how the JSON data is being formatted or handled

2. **Notification Error**: The error has changed from a database issue to a code error (accessing property 'match' of undefined). This suggests:
   - Database schema for notifications might be fixed
   - There's a code issue that needs to be addressed

## Recommendations

### 1. Fix Subscription Creation JSON Handling
- The issue appears to be with how the `configuration` field is being handled
- Verify that the `configuration` field in the database is properly defined as a JSON type
- Ensure the backend code is correctly handling the JSON field

### 2. Fix Notification Code Error
- The error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'match')" suggests a null check is needed
- Check notification related code for places where a 'match' property is accessed without verifying the parent object exists

### 3. Fix Template Service
- The template service is still returning 500 errors
- This may be related to the same JSON handling issues

## Conclusion

The new version has made progress by fixing the database schema issue with the missing "logo" column, but new issues have emerged:

1. A JSON syntax error when creating subscriptions
2. A code error when retrieving notifications

Authentication and subscription listing are working correctly, but template listing and notifications are still failing. Further fixes are needed before the system is fully functional.
