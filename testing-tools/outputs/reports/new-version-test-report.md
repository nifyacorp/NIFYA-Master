# NIFYA API New Backend Version Test Report

**Test Date:** April 4, 2025  
**Backend Version:** Latest  
**Test Environment:** Development

## Overview

The comprehensive test suite was run against the latest backend API version. Tests cover authentication, subscriptions, notifications, and core infrastructure services.

| Category | Success Rate | Status |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| Overall | 78% | ⚠️ PARTIAL SUCCESS |
| Authentication | 100% | ✅ PASS |
| Subscriptions | 57% | ⚠️ PARTIAL SUCCESS |
| Notifications | 50% | ⚠️ PARTIAL SUCCESS |
| Infrastructure | 100% | ✅ PASS |

## Detailed Results

### Authentication Tests

All authentication tests passed successfully. The backend properly handles:
- User login
- Token generation
- Refresh token functionality
- Session management

**Improvement:** Authentication service now shows reliable operation without intermittent 500 errors that were observed in previous tests.

### Subscription Tests

Subscription tests showed partial success with a 57% pass rate.

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| List Subscriptions | ✅ PASS | Correctly returns empty array when no subscriptions exist |
| Get Subscription Types | ✅ PASS | Returns available subscription types |
| Create BOE Subscription | ✅ PASS | Creates subscription with proper format |
| Create Real Estate Subscription | ✅ PASS | Creates subscription with proper format |
| Get Subscription Details | ❌ FAIL | Returns 500 error |
| Update Subscription | ❌ FAIL | Returns 500 error |
| Toggle Subscription | ❌ FAIL | Returns 500 error |
| Get Subscription Status | ❌ FAIL | Returns 500 error |
| Process Subscription | ✅ PASS | Successfully initiates processing |
| Share Subscription | ❌ FAIL | Returns 500 error |
| Remove Subscription Sharing | ❌ FAIL | Returns 500 error |
| Delete Subscription | ✅ PASS | Successfully deletes subscription |

**Note on Subscription Format:** The API now requires the `prompts` field to be sent as an object with a `value` property, rather than as an array of strings.

```json
// Required format
{
  "prompts": { "value": "Ayuntamiento Barcelona licitaciones" }
}

// Old format (no longer works)
{
  "prompts": ["Ayuntamiento Barcelona licitaciones"]
}
```

**Improvement:** Subscription types endpoint now works correctly, where it previously returned 500 errors.

### Notification Tests

Notification tests showed partial success with a 50% pass rate.

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| List Notifications | ❌ FAIL | Test times out waiting for notifications |
| Get Notifications by Entity Type | ✅ PASS | Successfully filters notifications |
| Get Notification Activity | ✅ PASS | Returns activity data |
| Poll Notifications | ❌ FAIL | No notifications found after multiple attempts |

### Infrastructure Tests

All infrastructure tests passed successfully.

| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Health Check | ✅ PASS | Service reports healthy status |
| API Diagnostics | ✅ PASS | Returns system diagnostics information |

## Issues and Recommendations

### Critical Issues

1. **Subscription Detail Endpoints Return 500 Errors**
   - Get, Update, Toggle, and Status endpoints all return 500 errors
   - Likely a server-side implementation issue or database connection problem
   - Priority: HIGH

2. **Subscription Sharing Functionality Broken**
   - Both share and unshare endpoints return 500 errors
   - Priority: MEDIUM

3. **Notification Polling Timeout**
   - Notification polling test fails after maximum attempts
   - May indicate issues with notification generation pipeline
   - Priority: HIGH

### Recommended Actions

1. **Backend Investigation:**
   - Examine server logs for the 500 errors occurring in subscription detail endpoints
   - Check database connections and schema for subscription tables
   - Verify notification processing pipeline is functioning

2. **Format Updates:**
   - Update frontend applications to use the new subscription prompt format:
     - `prompts: { value: "search text" }` instead of `prompts: ["search text"]`

3. **Further Testing:**
   - After backend fixes, re-run full test suite
   - Add specific tests for problematic endpoints with verbose logging
   - Test notification generation with manual triggers

## Comparison with Previous Version

| Feature | Previous Status | Current Status | Change |
|---------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| Authentication | ⚠️ UNSTABLE | ✅ OPERATIONAL | Fixed intermittent 500 errors |
| Subscription Listing | ✅ OPERATIONAL | ✅ OPERATIONAL | No change |
| Subscription Types | ❌ FAILING | ✅ OPERATIONAL | Fixed - now returns subscription types |
| Subscription Creation | ❌ FAILING | ✅ OPERATIONAL | Fixed - now accepts proper format |
| Subscription Details | ❌ FAILING | ❌ FAILING | No change - still returns 500 error |
| Notification Listing | ✅ OPERATIONAL | ✅ OPERATIONAL | No change |
| Notification Generation | ❌ FAILING | ❌ FAILING | No change - still not producing notifications |

## Conclusion

The new backend version shows significant improvements, particularly in authentication reliability and subscription type endpoints. These were critical issues in the previous version that are now fixed.

However, several significant issues remain:

1. Subscription detail endpoints (view, update, toggle, status) still return 500 errors
2. Subscription sharing functionality is not working
3. The notification generation pipeline appears to be broken, as no notifications are being created

Despite these issues, the overall success rate has improved to 78% (from 69% in the previous version), which represents meaningful progress.

The most urgent priorities for the next release should be:
1. Fix the 500 errors in subscription detail endpoints
2. Ensure the notification pipeline is generating notifications
3. Update frontend applications to use the new subscription prompt format
