# Subscription Service Issues Investigation

## Summary of Findings
Date: 2025-04-03T09:35:00Z

### 1. Database Schema Investigation

The database appears to have the correct tables for subscriptions:
- `subscription_types` - Contains types of subscriptions
- `subscriptions` - Contains user subscriptions
- `subscription_processing` - Tracks processing status of subscriptions
- `templates` (implied) - Likely stores templates for subscriptions

### 2. Subscription Types Endpoint Issue

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/subscriptions/types`

**Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "code": "TYPE_FETCH_ERROR",
  "message": "Failed to fetch subscription types"
}
```

**Analysis**:
- The endpoint returns a 500 error with a generic error message
- The error code is `TYPE_FETCH_ERROR` which suggests a problem retrieving subscription types from the database
- No detailed error information is provided
- The error is consistent across multiple tests

### 3. Template Service Issue

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/templates`

**Response**:
```json
{
  "error": "TEMPLATE_FETCH_ERROR",
  "message": "Failed to fetch public templates",
  "status": 500,
  "details": {},
  "timestamp": "2025-04-03T09:29:34.222Z"
}
```

**Analysis**:
- The endpoint returns a 500 error with a slightly more descriptive error message
- The error code is `TEMPLATE_FETCH_ERROR` which suggests a problem retrieving templates from the database
- No detailed error information is provided in the `details` field
- The error is consistent across multiple tests

### 4. Subscription Creation Issue

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/subscriptions`

**Response for Valid Request**:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "subscription": {}
  }
}
```

**Response for Invalid Request**:
```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "code": "FST_ERR_VALIDATION",
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "body must have required property 'type'"
}
```

**Analysis**:
- The endpoint correctly validates required fields (returns 400 if `type` is missing)
- When a valid request is sent, it returns a success status but with an empty subscription object
- Subscriptions created this way don't appear in the subscription listing
- The field name must be `type` not `type_id` (despite database column being `type_id`)

### 5. Subscription Listing

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/subscriptions`

**Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "subscriptions": [],
    "pagination": {
      "total": 0,
      "page": 1,
      "limit": 20,
      "totalPages": 0
    }
  }
}
```

**Analysis**:
- The endpoint returns a successful response with proper pagination structure
- No subscriptions are returned, even after "successful" creation attempts
- This suggests that while the API endpoint is working, the subscription creation process has an issue

## Possible Root Causes

1. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - The errors occur when trying to fetch data from specific tables
   - Both subscription types and templates return 500 errors
   - This could indicate permissions issues or missing data

2. **Empty or Corrupted Tables**:
   - The subscription_types table might be empty or corrupted
   - This would explain why the endpoint returns an error when trying to list types

3. **Missing Templates**:
   - Template fetching fails in a similar way to subscription types
   - This suggests related issues with the template data

4. **Subscription Creation Transaction Failure**:
   - The API accepts the creation request but returns an empty object
   - The database transaction may be rolling back due to foreign key constraints
   - This could be related to the missing subscription types

5. **API Version Mismatch**:
   - The API endpoint may be using different field names than the database schema
   - This is evidenced by the fact that `type` is required in the API but the column is `type_id` in the database

## Recommendations

1. **Check Database Content**:
   - Verify if the subscription_types table has any data
   - Check if any templates exist in the database

2. **Improve Error Handling**:
   - Modify the error responses to include more details about the underlying issue
   - This would make it easier to diagnose the problem

3. **Fix Database Schema**:
   - Ensure all required tables have the necessary data
   - Verify foreign key relationships are correct

4. **Debug Subscription Creation**:
   - Add more detailed logging to the subscription creation process
   - Trace the transaction to see where it's failing

5. **Fix API Field Mapping**:
   - Ensure the API properly maps fields from request body to database columns
   - Consider adding better validation to catch these issues earlier
