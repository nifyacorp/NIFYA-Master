# NIFYA Platform Testing Report

## Executive Summary

Our testing of the NIFYA platform has identified several critical issues that are preventing the full functioning of the subscription and notification system. The authentication system is working correctly, but users are unable to create new subscriptions due to a database schema mismatch. Additionally, the notification pipeline has several configuration and schema issues that would prevent notifications from being delivered even if subscriptions could be created.

## Test Results Summary

| Service | Component | Status | Critical Issues |
|---------|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Authentication | Login | ✅ PASS | None |
| Authentication | Profile | ✅ PASS | None |
| Backend | Subscription Listing | ✅ PASS | None |
| Backend | Subscription Creation | ❌ FAIL | Missing "logo" column in database |
| Backend | Templates | ❌ FAIL | Backend error (500) |
| Backend | Notifications | ✅ PASS | No notifications found |
| Pipeline | BOE Parser | ❌ FAIL | Authentication issues (401) |
| Pipeline | Notification Worker | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Message schema mismatch |
| Pipeline | PubSub | ❌ FAIL | Missing DLQ topics |

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Database Schema Issue

The most immediate issue preventing the system from functioning is a database schema mismatch. When attempting to create a subscription, the system returns:

```
Database operation failed: column "logo" of relation "subscriptions" does not exist
```

This indicates that the application code is trying to insert or update a "logo" field that doesn't exist in the database schema. This is likely due to:
- A missing migration that should have added this column
- A code change that was deployed before the corresponding database change

### 2. Notification Pipeline Issues

The existing documentation already identified several issues with the notification pipeline:

1. **Schema Mismatch**: The BOE Parser is sending messages in a format that the Notification Worker doesn't expect.
2. **Missing DLQ Resources**: Error handling is compromised due to missing "notification-dlq" topic.
3. **Authentication Issues**: The BOE Parser is failing authentication checks.

These issues would prevent notifications from being processed and delivered to users, even if subscriptions could be created and processed.

## Detailed Test Results

### Authentication Service

- **Login Test**: ✅ PASS
  - Successfully authenticated with valid credentials
  - Received valid JWT token with correct user information
  - Response time: ~0.5 seconds

- **Token Content**: Verified the token contains:
  - User ID: 65c6074d-dbc4-4091-8e45-b6aecffd9ab9
  - Email: ratonxi@gmail.com
  - Name: Test
  - Token type: access
  - Expiration: Set correctly (15 minutes)

### Backend Service - Subscriptions

- **Subscription Listing**: ✅ PASS
  - GET `/api/v1/subscriptions` returns correctly formatted empty array
  - Pagination information included in response

- **Subscription Creation**: ❌ FAIL
  - POST `/api/v1/subscriptions` fails with 500 error
  - Error indicates missing "logo" column in database schema
  - Request format otherwise seems correct (validated prompts field)

- **Template Listing**: ❌ FAIL
  - GET `/api/v1/templates` fails with 500 error
  - Error: "Failed to fetch public templates"

### Backend Service - Notifications

- **Notification Listing**: ✅ PASS
  - GET `/api/v1/notifications` returns correctly formatted empty array
  - No notifications were found after 10 polling attempts
  - This is expected since subscription creation is failing

## Recommended Fixes

### Immediate Fixes (Highest Priority)

1. **Fix Database Schema**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE subscriptions ADD COLUMN logo TEXT;
   ```
   - Verify if other columns are missing by comparing code models with actual schema
   - Consider implementing a schema validation test for CI/CD

2. **Create Missing PubSub Resources**:
   ```bash
   gcloud pubsub topics create notification-dlq --project=PROJECT_ID
   ```

3. **Fix Message Schema in BOE Parser**:
   Update the message format to match what the Notification Worker expects:
   ```javascript
   // Update in boe-parser/src/utils/pubsub.js
   results: {
     query_date: queryDate,
     matches: transformedMatches // Array of objects with prompt and documents
   }
   ```

### Medium Priority Fixes

1. **Add Error Resilience to Notification Worker**:
   Implement more robust error handling to deal with potential schema variations:
   ```javascript
   // Add to notification-worker/src/processors/boe.js
   if (!message.results?.matches || !Array.isArray(message.results.matches)) {
     // Try to recover by looking in legacy locations
     let matches = [];
     
     if (Array.isArray(message.results?.results?.[0]?.matches)) {
       matches = message.results.results[0].matches;
       logger.warn('Found matches in legacy location', { count: matches.length });
     } else if (message.results?.results) {
       matches = message.results.results.flatMap(r => 
         Array.isArray(r.matches) ? r.matches.map(m => ({...m, prompt: r.prompt})) : []
       );
     }
     
     if (matches.length > 0) {
       message.results.matches = matches;
     } else {
       throw new Error('Invalid message format: missing or invalid matches array');
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Standardize PubSub Configuration**:
   - Ensure all services are using consistent topic/subscription names
   - Document standard naming conventions

3. **Fix Authentication for BOE Parser**:
   - Review and fix the authentication configuration in the BOE Parser service
   - Ensure proper token handling for health checks

## Testing Verification Plan

After implementing these fixes, the following tests should be run to verify the solution:

1. **Database Fix Verification**:
   ```bash
   # Verify schema change
   node tests/subscriptions/create.js
   ```

2. **User Journey Test**:
   ```bash
   node tests/user-journeys/standard-flow.js
   ```
   - This should complete the full flow from authentication to notification

3. **Notification Pipeline Test**:
   ```bash
   # After creating a subscription, process it
   node tests/subscriptions/process.js
   
   # Then poll for notifications
   node tests/notifications/poll.js
   ```

## Conclusion

The NIFYA platform is experiencing several critical issues that prevent its core functionality from working. The most immediate issue is the database schema mismatch that prevents subscription creation. Even after fixing this, the notification pipeline has several configuration and schema issues that need to be addressed.

By implementing the recommended fixes in the order specified, the platform should be restored to full functionality. The testing tools we've created will make it easy to verify each fix as it's implemented.
