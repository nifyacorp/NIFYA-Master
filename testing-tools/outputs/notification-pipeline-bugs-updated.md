# Notification Pipeline Test Updates

## Test Run Comparison: 2025-04-05

### Initial Test (00-06-24)
- ❌ Failed with 404 error at subscription processing step
- Bug identified: Using auth token instead of subscription ID in API call
- User ID and subscription ID extraction not working correctly
- Test terminated prematurely

### Fixed Test (00-11-10)
- ✅ Subscription creation successful with ID: df6a9027-3f5b-4c00-87a3-487b62ce5581
- ✅ Subscription processing successful with status code 202
- ✅ User ID and subscription ID are now correctly extracted and used
- ✅ Complete test flow executed successfully 

### Remaining Issues

1. **No Notifications Generated**
   - Test completed successfully, but no notifications were created
   - API call returns 0 notifications when checking backend
   - This suggests a backend or worker issue, not a test framework issue
   - Need to investigate notification processing in the backend

2. **Worker Debug Endpoint Not Accessible**
   - Connection failed to notification worker debug endpoint
   - Error: SSL certificate hostname mismatch
   - Error: "notification-worker-415554190254.uc.run.app" not in cert's altnames
   - Possible incorrect worker URL configuration

### Technical Analysis

The test successfully:
- Authenticated with valid token
- Created a subscription (ID: df6a9027-3f5b-4c00-87a3-487b62ce5581)
- Processed the subscription with 202 status (accepted)
- Waited for processing (10-second delay)
- Checked for notifications (found 0)

The backend is confirming successful submission of the process request, but:
1. No notifications appear after waiting period
2. Worker debug endpoint is not accessible to verify worker state

### Root Cause Analysis

After investigating the code repositories, two key issues were identified:

1. **Notification Creation Logic Issue**
   - The `createNotifications` function in the subscription worker is incomplete
   - Critical notification creation code in `subscription-worker/src/services/subscriptionProcessor.js` contains only placeholder implementation
   - The implementation has comments about skipping PubSub notifications but doesn't appear to be creating database entries either
   
2. **SSL Certificate Configuration Issue**
   - The worker debug endpoint URL configuration doesn't match SSL certificate
   - CloudRun services have different URL formats for US Central region
   - Need to use `us-central1.run.app` instead of `uc.run.app` in the URL

### Next Steps to Fix

1. **Implement Notification Creation Logic**
   - Complete the `createNotifications` function in subscriptionProcessor.js
   - Implement proper database insertion for notifications
   - Ensure proper handling of the subscription response data to generate notifications
   - Implement proper error handling and retry logic
   
2. **Fix Worker Service URL Configuration**
   - Update worker URL in config to match SSL certificate
   - Change from `notification-worker-415554190254.uc.run.app` to `notification-worker-415554190254.us-central1.run.app`
   - Alternatively, for testing only: Set `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` to bypass SSL verification

3. **Improve Error Handling and Logging**
   - Add more detailed logging in the notification creation process
   - Implement better error handling with specific error codes
   - Add metrics for notification creation success/failure rates

4. **Enhance Testing**
   - Add longer wait times for notification processing (30+ seconds)
   - Implement polling logic to check for notifications multiple times
   - Add debug endpoints to check subscription processing status
