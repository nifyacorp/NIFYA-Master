# Notification Pipeline Test Bugs

## Test Execution: 2025-04-05T00-06-24

### Critical Issues

1. **Subscription Processing Endpoint Error**
   - **Bug Description**: When attempting to process a subscription, received a 404 Not Found error
   - **Error**: `Route POST:/api/v1/subscriptions/{token}/process not found`
   - **Cause**: The API client is incorrectly using the authentication token instead of the subscription ID for the process endpoint
   - **Log File**: `/outputs/logs/notification-pipeline/test-log-2025-04-05T00-06-24.log`
   - **Affected Files**: 
     - `/tests/integration/test-notification-pipeline.js`
     - `/tests/subscriptions/process.js`

2. **User ID Extraction Failure**
   - **Bug Description**: User ID is undefined when creating subscription
   - **Error**: Log shows `Successfully authenticated as user undefined` despite successful authentication
   - **Cause**: The auth result structure changed but the integration test doesn't properly extract the user ID
   - **Log File**: `/outputs/logs/notification-pipeline/test-log-2025-04-05T00-06-24.log`
   - **Affected Files**: 
     - `/tests/integration/test-notification-pipeline.js`

3. **Subscription ID Retrieval Failure**  
   - **Bug Description**: Subscription ID is undefined when processing the subscription
   - **Error**: Log shows `Successfully created subscription with ID: undefined` despite successful creation
   - **Cause**: The integration test doesn't correctly extract the subscription ID from the creation response
   - **Log File**: `/outputs/logs/notification-pipeline/test-log-2025-04-05T00-06-24.log`
   - **Affected Files**:
     - `/tests/integration/test-notification-pipeline.js`

4. **Test Flow Termination**
   - **Bug Description**: The test terminates after subscription processing failure without completing notification checks
   - **Cause**: The test doesn't implement a fallback mechanism for API errors
   - **Log File**: `/outputs/logs/notification-pipeline/test-log-2025-04-05T00-06-24.log`
   - **Affected Files**:
     - `/tests/integration/test-notification-pipeline.js`

### Recommended Fixes

1. **Fix subscription processing endpoint**:
   - Update the test to use the correct subscription ID (not the auth token) with the process endpoint
   - Ensure proper ID extraction from the creation response
   - Consider adding validation to prevent invalid IDs

2. **Improve user ID extraction**:
   - Update the authentication result parsing to handle various response formats
   - Add validation to verify user ID is present and valid

3. **Add error recovery mechanisms**:
   - Implement retry logic for transient errors
   - Add alternative endpoint fallbacks (try both process endpoints from endpoints.js)
   - Consider mocking responses for testing when live API fails

4. **Enhance logging and debugging**:
   - Add more detailed state logging between steps
   - Include request payloads and response data for better debugging
   - Implement proper error classification (critical vs. non-critical)

### Technical Notes

- Auth token is successfully obtained
- Subscription creation succeeds (ID: 393485a4-324a-4f42-8756-0d90022c9fc1)
- Processing step fails with 404 error
- Test implementation error causes undefined values for critical IDs
