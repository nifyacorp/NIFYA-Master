# User Journey Test Findings

## Overview
- **Test Result**: ❌ FAILED
- **Error**: Subscription creation failed due to API issues
- **Session ID**: 2025-04-03T07-31-04-623Z
- **Test Date**: 2025-04-03

## Step Results
1. **Authentication**: ✓ Passed
   - User ID: 65c6074d-dbc4-4091-8e45-b6aecffd9ab9
   - Token successfully obtained from auth service

2. **Subscription Creation**: ❌ Failed
   - Error: API returned empty subscription object with success status
   - API returned status code 201 (Created) but with empty subscription data
   - Journey terminated at this step

3. **Subscription Processing**: Not reached
   - Test terminated before this step due to subscription creation failure

4. **Notification Polling**: Not reached
   - Test terminated before this step due to subscription creation failure

## Critical API Issue
The API is returning a successful status code with empty data, which is inconsistent behavior:

```json
{"status":"success","data":{"subscription":{}}}
```

The API indicates success (status code 201) but the subscription object is empty, making it impossible to proceed with the user journey. This represents a critical issue in the API that needs immediate attention.

## Test Artifacts
- **Log files**: `outputs/logs/*-2025-04-03T07-31-04-623Z.log`
- **Journey state**: `outputs/reports/user_journey_state.json`
- **Journey log**: `outputs/reports/user_journey_log.md`
- **API responses**: 
  - `outputs/auth_response.json`
  - `outputs/create_subscription_response.json`

## Recommended Actions
1. **CRITICAL**: Investigate the subscription creation endpoint
   - Why is it returning an empty subscription object?
   - Is this a backend database issue, permissions issue, or API implementation issue?
   
2. **Backend Team**: Check the subscription creation logic
   - Verify database connections and writes
   - Ensure proper error handling and validation
   - Fix the issue where API returns success but doesn't create a subscription
   
3. **Testing Team**: 
   - Rerun tests after backend fixes are implemented
   - Add specific tests for edge cases in subscription creation
   
4. **Frontend Team**:
   - Implement defensive handling for this case
   - Validate subscription creation responses thoroughly
   - Add user-friendly error messages for this scenario

## Additional Notes
- The test is now correctly reporting this as a failure rather than simulating success
- This issue likely affects real users attempting to create subscriptions
- The fix needs to be prioritized as it breaks the core user journey
