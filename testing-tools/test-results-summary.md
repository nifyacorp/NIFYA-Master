## Remaining Issues

1. **Critical Issues**:
   - Authentication service showing intermittent 500 errors
   - Subscription types endpoint still returning 500 error
   - Template service endpoints still returning 500 error

2. **Secondary Issues**:
   - Subscription creation returning 400 error (missing required fields)
   - Test notification creation endpoint not available

## Latest Findings

1. **Authentication Service Instability**:
   - Direct login test works consistently
   - Enhanced journey test shows intermittent 500 errors from authentication service
   - May indicate increased load or resource issues on the auth service

2. **Stability of Other Endpoints**:
   - User profile endpoints remain stable and working
   - Notification endpoints remain stable and working
   - Subscription endpoints (except types) remain stable

## Recommendations

1. **High Priority**:
   - Investigate the intermittent authentication service 500 errors
   - Fix the subscription types endpoint which remains the primary blocker for the enhanced journey
   - Address the template service errors which will be needed for subscription creation

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Improve error handling in authentication service to avoid 500 responses

3. **Low Priority**:
   - Add the test notification creation endpoint

## Conclusion

While previous improvements to the user profile endpoints are stable, we're now seeing intermittent authentication service issues that weren't present in the previous test. This suggests a possible regression or instability introduced in the latest update.

The overall endpoint success rate remains at 69% (11/16 endpoints passing), but the enhanced journey test now shows inconsistent behavior due to the authentication service occasionally returning 500 errors.

The subscription types endpoint continues to be the main blocker when authentication succeeds, preventing the journey from proceeding further. This should be prioritized along with investigating the authentication service instability.
