## Test Results Analysis

### Authentication Tests
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED
- **Details**: Authentication service correctly returns JWT tokens and user information
- **Notes**: Authentication is working properly and returns a valid token

### Infrastructure Tests
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED
- **Details**: The `/health` endpoint returns correct status information
- **Notes**: System reports healthy status and database connection is verified

### Subscription Tests
- **Status**: ⚠️ MIXED RESULTS
- **Details**: 
  - Subscription Listing: ✅ PASSED (returns empty array with proper pagination)
  - Subscription Creation: ❌ FAILED with "Database operation failed: insert or update on table \"subscriptions\" violates foreign key constraint \"subscriptions_user_id_fkey\""
  - Subscription Creation with User ID: ❌ FAILED with the same foreign key constraint error
- **Analysis**: The API correctly handles the request format but the user record doesn't exist in the backend database

### Notification Tests
- **Status**: ⚠️ MIXED RESULTS
- **Details**: 
  - `GET /api/v1/notifications?entityType=subscription` - ✅ WORKING (returns empty array with pagination)
  - `GET /api/v1/notifications` (standard polling) - ❌ FAILING

### Diagnostic Endpoints
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED
- **Working Endpoints**:
  - `/api/diagnostics` - Lists available diagnostic endpoints
  - `/health` - Reports service health (database connected, memory usage, etc.)
  - `/api/diagnostics/db-tables` - Lists database tables (8 tables found)
  - `/api/diagnostics/db-status` - Reports database status (connected)
- **Remaining Issues**:
  - `/api/diagnostics/user` - Returns 500 Internal Server Error with message "Authentication error"
  - User validation appears to fail on the backend despite valid token

## API Client Test Improvements

We've made several improvements to the test client:

1. **Fixed Auth Headers**: Our API client now properly includes the Authorization header with the Bearer token
2. **Added User ID Header**: We now include the x-user-id header extracted from the JWT token
3. **Improved Success Detection**: Tests now recognize success responses via the status field in JSON

These improvements revealed the underlying issue with most tests:

## Root Cause: User Record Missing in Database

The primary issue is now clearly identified:

1. The authentication service issues valid JWT tokens 
2. The backend API properly validates the token
3. But the user record from the token doesn't exist in the database
4. This triggers foreign key constraint errors in operations that need the user record

## Recommended Fix: User Synchronization

The most important fix needed is implementing user synchronization between the auth service and backend database:

```javascript
// Implement in the auth middleware on the backend:
async function syncUserFromToken(req, res, next) {
  try {
    const userId = req.user.sub; // Extracted from JWT token
    
    // Check if user exists in database
    const userExists = await db.query(
      'SELECT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE id = $1)',
      [userId]
    );
    
    // If user doesn't exist, create it from token data
    if (!userExists.rows[0].exists) {
      console.log(`Creating user record for ${userId}`);
      
      await db.query(
        'INSERT INTO users (id, email, name, email_verified) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4)',
        [
          userId,
          req.user.email || 'unknown@example.com',
          req.user.name || 'Unknown User',
          req.user.email_verified || false
        ]
      );
      
      console.log(`User record created for ${userId}`);
    }
    
    // Continue with the request
    next();
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error synchronizing user from token:', err);
    // Don't fail the request, just log the error
    next();
  }
}
```

## Secondary Issues

1. **Notification Polling**: The notifications/poll.js test still fails, likely related to the same user sync issue
2. **User Validation**: The user validation endpoint fails with a 500 error

## Conclusion

Our test improvements have allowed us to identify the real issues:

1. The most critical issue is the missing user record in the database (foreign key constraint)
2. The API itself works correctly with proper headers and body format
3. The subscription listing endpoint is now working with our fixed client
4. The database is properly connected and configured

Implementing the user synchronization mechanism will likely fix most of the remaining issues, as they stem from the same root cause of missing user records in the database.

## Next Steps

1. **Implement User Sync**: Add the user synchronization middleware to the backend
2. **Run Tests Again**: Once the fix is deployed, run the tests again to verify
3. **Create Test API Endpoint**: Add a simple API endpoint to manually create test users if needed
4. **Fix Notification Tests**: Update the notification tests to handle the improved API response format
