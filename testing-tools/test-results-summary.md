## Remaining Issues

1. **Critical Issues**:
   - Subscription types endpoint returning 500 error
   - Template service endpoints returning 500 error
   - User profile endpoints returning 404 error

2. **Secondary Issues**:
   - Subscription creation returning empty objects
   - Test notification creation endpoint not available

## Recommendations

1. **High Priority**:
   - Fix the subscription types endpoint which is now the primary blocker for the enhanced journey
   - Address the template service errors which will be needed for subscription creation

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Implement or fix the user profile endpoints
   - Investigate why subscription creation returns empty objects

3. **Low Priority**:
   - Add the test notification creation endpoint

## API Client Improvements

The token refresh mechanism is now working correctly and has resolved many of the previous authorization issues. This allows authenticated endpoints to work properly without token expiration problems.

## Conclusion

The service update has made significant progress in fixing authentication issues and authorization for multiple endpoints. The enhanced journey test now progresses further, completing the authentication step successfully before failing at subscription types retrieval.

The key improvement is in token handling and authentication, which has fixed 4 previously failing notification endpoints and the subscription listing endpoint. However, several critical endpoints still have issues, preventing the journey from completing successfully.

Focusing on fixing the subscription types endpoint should be the next priority as it's the current blocker in the enhanced user journey test.
