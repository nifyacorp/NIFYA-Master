## Remaining Issues

1. **Critical Issues**:
   - Subscription types endpoint still returning 500 error
   - Template service endpoints still returning 500 error

2. **Secondary Issues**:
   - Subscription creation returning 400 error (missing required fields)
   - Test notification creation endpoint not available

## Recommendations

1. **High Priority**:
   - Fix the subscription types endpoint which remains the primary blocker for the enhanced journey
   - Address the template service errors which will be needed for subscription creation

2. **Low Priority**:
   - Add the test notification creation endpoint

## Notable Improvements

1. **User Profile Service**:
   - The user profile endpoints are now working correctly
   - `/api/v1/me` now returns the user profile data
   - `/api/v1/me/email-preferences` now returns the user's email notification preferences

2. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Token handling continues to work correctly
   - All authenticated endpoints are returning proper responses

3. **Success Rate Trend**:
   - Initial test: 25% success rate
   - Previous test: 56% success rate 
   - Current test: 69% success rate
   - Clear upward trend in service reliability

## Conclusion

The service updates have made significant progress in fixing critical issues. The user profile service is now operational, which is a major improvement. The enhanced journey test now successfully completes the authentication and user profile steps but still fails at the subscription types step.

The key remaining blocker is the subscription types endpoint which continues to return a 500 error. This is preventing the journey from proceeding to the subscription creation and notification steps.

Focusing on fixing the subscription types endpoint and template service should be the next priorities to complete the enhanced user journey test.
