  - [ ] Implement consistent migration strategy
  - [ ] Document database schema dependencies between services
  - [ ] Create database schema validation tests

## Monitoring & Observability

- [ ] **Implement comprehensive logging**
  - [ ] Standardize log format and levels across services
  - [ ] Add correlation IDs for request tracing
  - [ ] Ensure logs capture all inter-service communication

- [ ] **Setup centralized monitoring**
  - [ ] Deploy metrics collection for all services
  - [ ] Create dashboards for service health and communication
  - [ ] Setup alerts for communication failures

- [ ] **Create diagnostic tools for each communication path**
  - [ ] Expand `diagnose-subscription-processing.ps1` to cover all services
  - [ ] Create `test-notification-processing.js` similar to `test-boe-connectivity.js`
  - [ ] Implement automated communication checks

## Error Handling & Resilience

- [ ] **Improve error handling in inter-service communication**
  - [ ] Standardize error responses across all services
  - [ ] Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
  - [ ] Add circuit breakers for failing services

- [ ] **Implement fallback mechanisms**
  - [ ] Define fallback behavior when services are unavailable
  - [ ] Create degraded service modes
  - [ ] Implement queue-based processing for reliability

- [ ] **Develop recovery procedures**
  - [ ] Document steps to recover from each type of communication failure
  - [ ] Create runbooks for common issues
  - [ ] Implement self-healing where possible

## Security & Access Control

- [ ] **Audit and standardize authentication**
  - [ ] Review and document all service-to-service authentication
  - [ ] Implement consistent API key management
  - [ ] Rotate credentials regularly

- [ ] **Implement fine-grained access control**
  - [ ] Define service-level permissions
  - [ ] Audit access patterns
  - [ ] Implement least privilege principles

## Specific Fixes

- [ ] **Fix BOE Parser communication issue**
  - [ ] Run `test-boe-connectivity.js` to diagnose connection problems
  - [ ] Verify the BOE parser service is running and accessible
  - [ ] Check network configuration and firewall rules
  - [ ] Update API keys if needed

- [ ] **Unify middleware organization**
  - [ ] Complete the middleware folder consolidation
  - [ ] Ensure consistent middleware usage across routes

- [ ] **Complete subscription routes refactoring**
  - [ ] Finish implementing all modular subscription route files
  - [ ] Update main application to use the new routes
  - [ ] Remove deprecated code

## Project Management

  - [ ] Assign primary and secondary owners to each service
  - [ ] Document responsibilities for each integration point
  - [ ] Establish communication protocols for changes

- [ ] **Schedule regular integration reviews**
  - [ ] Review logs and metrics for communication issues monthly
  - [ ] Conduct quarterly end-to-end testing
  - [ ] Update documentation based on findings

- [ ] **Setup automated deployment coordination**
  - [ ] Ensure dependent services are deployed in the correct order
  - [ ] Implement version compatibility checks
  - [ ] Create rollback procedures for failed deployments
