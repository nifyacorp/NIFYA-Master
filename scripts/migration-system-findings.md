# Migration System Findings

Based on the backend service logs, we've identified several issues with the current migration system:

## Key Issues

1. **Function Dependencies**:
   - Error: `function current_user_id() does not exist`
   - Migration `20250130114438_late_beacon.sql` fails because it relies on a function that doesn't exist yet
   - This creates a chicken-and-egg problem where migrations need functions that are supposed to be created by other migrations

2. **Column Dependencies**:
   - Error: `column "is_system" does not exist`
   - RLS policies in migration `20250324000000_fix_rls_policies.sql` reference columns that don't exist yet
   - This suggests that migrations are not properly ordered or have implicit dependencies

3. **Schema Version Tracking**:
   - The system attempts to create the `schema_migrations` table multiple times
   - This indicates issues with the existing migration tracking system

## Approach Confirmation

Our startup migration approach addresses these issues by:

1. **Checking Before Creating**:
   - Verifying if tables/columns exist before attempting to create or modify them
   - This avoids the errors caused by missing prerequisites

2. **Idempotent Operations**:
   - Using `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` and similar patterns
   - Adding columns only if they don't exist
   - This ensures migrations can be reapplied safely

3. **Standalone Migration System**:
   - The startup migration system doesn't rely on the existing schema_migrations table
   - It creates its own version tracking mechanism if needed

4. **No Function Dependencies**:
   - Our startup migration avoids using functions like `current_user_id()` that might not exist yet
   - Each migration is self-contained with all its dependencies

## Next Steps

1. Complete and test the startup migration system on development/staging
2. Deploy with startup migration enabled via environment variable
3. Monitor the logs during initial deployment to verify success
4. Consider consolidating schema into a single file for fresh installations

The log analysis confirms our approach is on the right track. The existing migration system is facing circular dependencies and ordering issues that our startup migration system addresses directly.
