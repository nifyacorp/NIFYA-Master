# Notification Pipeline Fix Summary

## Issue Diagnosis

1. **API Endpoint Mismatch**: 
   - Frontend was calling `/v1/notifications` but backend required `/api/v1/notifications`
   - Confirmed this was working correctly in our tests with the correct `X-User-ID` header

2. **BOE Parser Issues**:
   - Fixed character-by-character logging issue in logger.js
   - Changed Gemini model from "gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05" to "gemini-2.0-flash-lite" to avoid rate limits
   - Added filtering of BOE items to reduce token count
   - Limited number of items sent to Gemini to stay within token limits

3. **Row-Level Security (RLS)**:
   - Confirmed RLS context setting is working properly
   - API endpoints return empty notifications arrays (not errors)

4. **Missing Notifications Creation**:
   - After processing a subscription, no notifications appear in the database
   - This suggests the notification worker might not be properly processing PubSub messages from the BOE parser

## Resolution Plan

1. **Check Notification Worker Logs**:
   - Monitor Cloud Logging for notification worker errors
   - Look specifically for any issues with PubSub message format or parsing

2. **Verify PubSub Topic Configuration**:
   - Ensure the BOE parser is publishing to the correct topic
   - Verify the notification worker is subscribed to this topic

3. **Add Diagnostics to Notification Worker**:
   - Enhance logging in the notification-worker to log all received messages
   - Add specific logging for the message parsing and notification creation steps

4. **Test Both Components Separately**:
   - Use test scripts to publish test messages directly to the PubSub topic
   - Create separate test scripts to verify notification worker functionality

5. **Fix Notification Message Format**:
   - Ensure the notification format sent by the BOE parser matches what the notification worker expects
   - Update one or both components to ensure compatibility

## Implementation Approach

1. First, enhance logging in the notification worker to capture all received messages
2. Next, run a test to process a subscription and monitor logs
3. If no messages are being received, check the BOE parser to ensure it's publishing correctly
4. Add diagnostic endpoints to both components to facilitate testing
5. Fix any identified issues with message format or processing

This approach focuses on identifying the exact point of failure in the pipeline, then making targeted fixes to ensure notifications are properly created and delivered to the frontend.
