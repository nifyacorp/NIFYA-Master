# Notification Pipeline Test Summary

## Overview

We conducted extensive testing of the notification pipeline to identify and fix issues with notifications not appearing in the frontend despite subscriptions being successfully processed. This document presents our findings and recommended next steps.

## Findings

1. **BOE Parser Issues (Fixed)**
   - Fixed character-by-character logging issue in logger.js
   - Changed Gemini model from "gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05" to "gemini-2.0-flash-lite" to avoid rate limits
   - Added filtering for BOE items to reduce token count
   - Limited the number of items sent to Gemini to stay within token limits
   - These changes have improved the BOE parser's stability and reliability

2. **API Route Issues (Fixed)**
   - Confirmed the frontend was correctly calling `/v1/notifications` endpoint
   - Backend API endpoints properly registered with proper v1 prefixes
   - API authentication requires X-User-ID header (confirmed this works)

3. **Missing Notifications (Ongoing Issue)**
   - API endpoints return empty notifications arrays, not errors
   - After processing subscriptions, no notifications appear in the database
   - This suggests a breakdown in the notification worker's processing pipeline

4. **Pipeline Workflow Analysis**
   - When a subscription is processed, the following should happen:
     1. Backend sends message to BOE-parser topic
     2. BOE-parser processes data and sends to notification-topic
     3. Notification-worker processes message and creates DB record
     4. Frontend retrieves notifications via API
   - Based on our testing, the issue appears to be in steps 2-3

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate PubSub Message Flow**
   - Monitor Cloud Logging for the notification worker
   - Look for any errors in parsing PubSub messages
   - Verify that the BOE parser is publishing to the correct topic
   - Verify that message format is compatible between components

2. **Enhance Notification Worker Logging**
   - Add more detailed logging for:
     - Message receipt from PubSub
     - Message parsing and validation
     - Database operations during notification creation
   - Enable debug logging in production temporarily to capture issues

3. **Add Diagnostics to Notification Pipeline**
   - Create a diagnostic API endpoint to query notification status
   - Add a test endpoint to publish a test notification to PubSub
   - Build a monitoring dashboard for the notification pipeline

4. **Fix PubSub Message Format**
   - Ensure the notification format sent by the BOE parser matches what the notification worker expects
   - Update notification worker or BOE parser as needed to ensure compatibility
   - Configure proper DLQ (Dead Letter Queue) for failed messages

5. **Consider RLS Policy Review**
   - While our tests suggest RLS is configured correctly, a review of the DB policies would be prudent
   - Verify that newly created notifications have the correct user_id field
   - Test direct database queries to confirm notifications exist

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Focus on Notification Worker First**
   - Add enhanced logging to notification worker
   - Deploy the updated worker to production
   - Process a subscription and analyze logs

2. **Test Isolated Components**
   - Create a test script to publish a test message directly to the notification topic
   - This will help determine if the issue is with the BOE parser (publishing) or notification worker (processing)

3. **Monitor the End-to-End Flow**
   - Use the created test-notification-pipeline.sh script to monitor the entire flow
   - Add additional diagnostics as needed to isolate the issue

4. **Fix and Verify**
   - Once the issue is identified, implement the necessary fix
   - Verify with the same test script to ensure notifications are created and retrieved

By systematically following these steps, we should be able to identify and fix the remaining issues with the notification pipeline.
