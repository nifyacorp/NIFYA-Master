# NIFYA API v1 Update Testing Results

## Summary of Findings

After investigating the API issues and implementing updated test scripts, here are the key findings:

1. **API Versioning Confirmed**: The backend API has implemented versioning using a `/v1/` prefix.
2. **Required Headers Addition**: The v1 API endpoints require an additional `x-user-id` header with the user ID.
3. **Fixed Scripts Success**: The updated scripts with the v1 API paths and new headers are working correctly.
4. **Successful Endpoints**:
   - `GET /api/v1/subscriptions`: Returns a list of user subscriptions (200 OK)
   - `GET /api/v1/notifications`: Returns user notifications (200 OK, though empty)
   - `POST /api/v1/subscriptions/{id}/process`: Attempts to process a subscription (500 error due to backend issue)

## Implemented Fixes

1. **Created API Client Helper**: Implemented a shared API client module (`api-client.js`) with:
   - Automatic user ID extraction from JWT token
   - Proper header setting
   - Error handling and redirect detection
   - Response saving functionality

2. **Updated Script Versions**:
   - `list-subscriptions-v1.js`: Lists subscriptions using the v1 API
   - `process-subscription-v1.js`: Processes a subscription using the v1 API
   - `poll-notifications-v1.js`: Polls for notifications using the v1 API

3. **Comprehensive Documentation**:
   - `notification_pipeline_test_summary.md`: Summary of test findings
   - `notification_pipeline_fix_plan.md`: Detailed plan for fixing all scripts
   - `api_v1_test_results.md`: Detailed API testing results

## Current Status

1. **Authentication Service**: Working correctly with proper rate limiting
2. **Subscription Listing**: Working correctly with the v1 API path and user ID header
3. **Subscription Processing**: API path accessible but returns 500 error due to backend code issue
4. **Notification Polling**: API path accessible but no notifications found

## Backend Issues Identified

1. **Subscription Processing Error**:
   ```json
   {
     "statusCode": 500,
     "error": "Internal Server Error",
     "message": "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'match')"
   }
   ```
   This indicates a coding issue in the backend subscription processing logic.

2. **Notification Pipeline**:
   - Despite the API endpoints being accessible, no notifications are generated
   - This could be due to multiple issues:
     - The subscription processing error preventing notification creation
     - Issues with the BOE Parser service
     - PubSub configuration or DLQ topic issues as outlined in previous documents

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Backend Subscription Processing**:
   - Investigate the `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'match')` error
   - Check the data format being passed to the subscription processor

2. **Verify PubSub Configuration**:
   - Create the required DLQ topics as outlined in the solution
   - Verify the message schema matches what's expected

3. **Update All Scripts**:
   - Convert all remaining scripts to use the v1 API paths
   - Apply the user ID header to all requests

4. **Complete End-to-End Testing**:
   - Once backend fixes are in place, verify the entire notification pipeline

## Conclusion

The API versioning change was successfully identified and fixed in the test scripts. The updated scripts now correctly communicate with the backend API using the v1 endpoints and required headers. However, there appear to be backend issues that need to be addressed before the notification pipeline can work correctly end-to-end.
