# Notification Pipeline Fixes PR

## Summary
- Fixed the API client to handle the v1 API endpoints correctly
- Added proper error handling for subscription processing
- Fixed the "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'match')" error
- Added comprehensive documentation of the notification pipeline issues and fixes

## Changes Made

### API Client Updates
- Enhanced error handling with try/catch blocks
- Added path sanitization to prevent malformed paths
- Improved user ID extraction from JWT tokens
- Added support for v1 API endpoints

### Script Updates
- Fixed process-subscription-v1.js to include proper request body
- Added UUID formatting to prevent match errors
- Enhanced error reporting for debugging

### Documentation
- Created subscription-process-issue-fix.md with detailed error analysis
- Updated NOTIFICATION-PIPELINE-CONCLUSIONS.md with comprehensive findings
- Added testing verification results

## Test Results
The updated scripts now successfully:
- Authenticate with the auth service
- Process subscriptions through the v1 API
- Handle error responses correctly
- Display comprehensive debugging information

## Screenshots
(Include screenshots of successful API responses)

## Testing Instructions
1. Run the auth login script: `node auth-login.js`
2. Process a subscription: `node process-subscription-v1.js`
3. Poll for notifications: `node poll-notifications-v1.js`

## Technical Debt
- Backend should add additional error handling for undefined values
- Standardize API error responses across all endpoints
- Add schema validation for request bodies
