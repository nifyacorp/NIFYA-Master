# Subscription System Implementation Progress

## Completed

### Phase 1: Services and Types Update
- Updated `SubscriptionType` interface in `frontend/src/lib/api/services/subscription-types.ts`
- Updated `Subscription` interface in `frontend/src/services/api/subscription-service.ts`
- Updated API parameters and request handling for the new schema

### Phase 2: Component Updates
- Updated `SubscriptionTypeSelector.tsx` to display subscription types with new fields (display_name, icon, logo_url)
- Updated `SubscriptionForm.tsx` form schema for new subscription structure (type_id, prompts, frequency)
- Updated `SubscriptionCard.tsx` to display subscription data from the new schema (active instead of isActive, type_name instead of source)

### Phase 3: Routing Update
- Created new `SubscriptionTypes.tsx` page (formerly NewSubscription.tsx)
- Updated routes in `App.tsx` to use the new flow:
  - Added `/subscriptions/types` route
  - Redirected old routes to new structure
  - Maintained backwards compatibility with redirects
- Updated navigation in `Subscriptions.tsx` to point to the new routes

## In Progress

### Phase 4: Minimal Viable Product Delivery
- Testing the new components and routes

## Remaining Tasks

1. Verify that the `SubscriptionForm.tsx` component correctly handles the new data structure when creating/updating subscriptions
2. Ensure `Subscriptions.tsx` main page properly displays subscriptions with the new schema
3. Test end-to-end flow:
   - View subscriptions list
   - Navigate to subscription types page
   - Select a type
   - Configure and submit the form
   - Verify new subscription appears in the list
4. Error handling and validation

## Known Issues

- Warning about imports in `SubscriptionForm.tsx` that need to be resolved
- Potential API compatibility issues during transition to new schema

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining component updates
2. Test all components with actual API data
3. Fix any identified issues
4. Document the new subscription system for future reference
