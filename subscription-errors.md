# Subscription Process Errors

## Navigation Issues

1. **Inconsistent URL Structure**
   - Expected: `/subscriptions/create/{template-id}`
   - Actual: `/subscriptions/new/{template-id}`
   - Impact: Can cause confusion in automation scripts and documentation

## Element Identification Challenges

1. **Inconsistent Selectors**
   - Issue: Template cards and buttons lack consistent class names or data-testid attributes
   - Impact: Makes it difficult to reliably target elements in automation scripts
   - Fix: Add consistent data-testid attributes to all interactive elements

2. **Deeply Nested DOM Structure**
   - Issue: Complex nesting makes it challenging to target specific elements
   - Example: Template cards are nested within multiple container divs
   - Fix: Simplify DOM structure or add more direct selectors

## Form Submission Problems

1. **Incomplete Redirect Flow**
   - Issue: After submitting the form, the application sometimes remains on the `/subscriptions/new` page instead of redirecting to `/subscriptions`
   - Impact: Makes it difficult to determine if the subscription was successfully created
   - Fix: Ensure consistent redirect after form submission

## API Integration

1. **API Response Validation**
   - Issue: Some API responses lack proper validation or error handling
   - Example: Subscription creation API call might accept invalid inputs
   - Fix: Implement stricter validation and provide clearer error messages

## UI/UX Issues

1. **Form Feedback**
   - Issue: Limited user feedback during form submission
   - Impact: Users may be unsure if their action was successful
   - Fix: Add loading indicators and success/error messages

## Recommended Fixes (Backend)

1. Add validation middleware to all API endpoints
2. Implement consistent URL structure for all CRUD operations
3. Return detailed error messages when validation fails

## Recommended Fixes (Frontend)

1. Add data-testid attributes to all interactive elements
2. Implement consistent loading/success/error states
3. Fix redirect logic after form submission
