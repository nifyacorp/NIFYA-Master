# API Mismatches and Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes implemented to resolve API mismatches between frontend and backend endpoints across the NIFYA platform.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Authentication Endpoints
- **Token Refresh** ✅ 
  - The backend already had the `/api/auth/refresh` endpoint implemented in the Authentication Service
  - Verified the implementation and ensured it properly handles token refreshing

### 2. Email Preferences
- **Email Notification Settings** ✅
  - Fixed path mismatches between frontend and backend
  - Updated frontend to use correct path: `/v1/users/me/email-preferences` instead of `/v1/me/email-preferences`

### 3. Subscription Functionality
- **Subscription Processing Status** ✅
  - Found that the `/api/v1/subscriptions/:id/status` endpoint was already implemented in the backend
  - Confirmed correct implementation in `status.routes.js`
  
- **Subscription Sharing** ✅
  - Implemented `shareSubscription` and `removeSubscriptionSharing` methods in the subscription service
  - Created migration script to ensure the `subscription_shares` table exists
  - Added PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS) policies for secure subscription sharing

### 4. Notification Features
- **Notification Statistics** ✅
  - Found that `/api/v1/notifications/stats` endpoint was already implemented
  - Confirmed implementation in the notification controller

- **Notification Activity** ✅
  - Found that `/api/v1/notifications/activity` endpoint was already implemented
  - Verified implementation in the notification controller

## Schema Changes
- Added `subscription_shares` table for tracking shared subscriptions
- Created appropriate indexes and RLS policies for the new table

## Next Steps
- Deploy the new migration script to create the subscription sharing table
- Test all fixed endpoints with frontend integration
- Consider adding analytics UI components to visualize notification activity data

## Testing
All endpoints have been manually verified by examining the code and ensuring proper implementation. To fully validate the fixes, run the test script:

```bash
$ npm run test-api-endpoints
```

## Notes
Several of the endpoints that appeared to be missing were actually already implemented in the backend but weren't being called correctly by the frontend. In most cases, the solution was to adjust the frontend paths to match the backend implementation rather than modifying the backend.
