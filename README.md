# Backend Services Collection

A collection of microservices that power the backend implementation of [Your Website Name].

## Overview

This repository contains the API services, data processing modules, and infrastructure configuration needed to run the backend of [Your Website Name]. The backend is built as a collection of services that work together to provide the complete functionality required by the frontend.

## Project Structure

This repository is structured as follows:
- Backend services (root directory)
- Frontend application (submodule at `./frontend`)

## Services

- **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization
- **User Service**: Manages user data and profiles
- **[Other Service Name]**: [Brief description]
- **[Other Service Name]**: [Brief description]

## Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **API Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: [Database Name - e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL]
- **Caching**: [Caching Solution - e.g., Redis]
- **Authentication**: [Auth Method - e.g., JWT, OAuth]
- **Deployment**: [Deployment Platform - e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, AWS]

## Adding Frontend as a Submodule

I'll help you incorporate the front-end repository (https://github.com/nifyacorp/main_page) as a Git submodule in your backend project. This is a good approach for managing separate repositories that are part of the same application. 

# Terminal Commands to Add the Frontend Submodule

Let me provide you with the specific terminal commands to add the frontend as a submodule. But first, let's fix the README which seems to have some of my explanation text in it.
