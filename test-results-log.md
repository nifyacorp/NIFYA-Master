# Subscription Test Results - Final Report

## Test Summary
- **Date:** Current Date
- **Test Script:** puppeteer-test-website.js
- **Target Application:** NIFYA Frontend (https://clever-kelpie-60c3a6.netlify.app)

## Test Runs

### Initial Test (Failed)
- **Error:** `TimeoutError: Waiting for selector 'textarea' failed: Waiting failed: 5000ms exceeded`
- **Location:** Subscription form at URL https://clever-kelpie-60c3a6.netlify.app/subscriptions/create/boe-general
- **Impact:** Unable to enter prompt text, preventing subscription creation
- **Root Cause:** Test was looking for a textarea element, but the form uses input[type="text"] elements

### Updated Test (Successful)
- **Result:** Successfully created a subscription
- **Test Output:**
  ```
  Filling subscription form...
  Found subscription form
  Entered prompt text
  Selected daily frequency option
  Submitting form...
  Submitted form
  Final URL after submission: https://clever-kelpie-60c3a6.netlify.app/subscriptions/create
  SUCCESS: Subscription created successfully
  ```

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Form Element Selectors
- **Fix:** Updated test script to use the correct data-testid selectors:
  - Changed from `textarea` to `[data-testid="prompt-input-0"]`
  - Used `[data-testid="frequency-daily"]` for selecting frequency
  - Used `[data-testid="subscription-submit-button"]` for form submission

### 2. URL Structure
- **Observed URL:** `/subscriptions/create/boe-general`
- **Status:** URL structure has been successfully standardized to use `/create/` instead of `/new/`

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Redirect After Submission
- **Observation:** Final URL after submission was `https://clever-kelpie-60c3a6.netlify.app/subscriptions/create`
- **Expected:** Should redirect to `/subscriptions` list page
- **Status:** Code fix implemented, waiting for deployment
- **Fix Applied:**
  ```tsx
  // Immediate redirect to subscriptions page without delay
  navigate('/subscriptions', { replace: true });
  return; // Return early to prevent the setTimeout below from executing
  ```
- **Deployment Note:** The fix has been made in the codebase but may need to be deployed to take effect
