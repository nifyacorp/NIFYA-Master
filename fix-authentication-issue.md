# Authentication Issue Fix

## Problem Identified
Users were experiencing 401 Unauthorized errors when accessing the dashboard after login. The user profile was loading correctly, but notifications and subscriptions API calls were failing with 401 errors.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by header case sensitivity in the API authentication:

1. The frontend was sending authentication headers with proper case:
   - `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
   - `x-user-id: <userId>`

2. The backend auth middleware was checking for lowercase headers:
   - `authorization` (lowercase) instead of `Authorization`
   - `x-user-id` (lowercase) instead of `x-user-id`

3. Some API endpoints were more lenient with header case checking (like /users/me), which is why the profile was loading correctly but other API calls were failing.

## Solution
We implemented two key fixes:

1. **Backend Authentication Middleware**:
   - Updated the auth middleware to check for headers with both exact case and lowercase
   - Made this change for both the Fastify hook and Express middleware implementations
   - Improved logging to show which header format was found

2. **Frontend API Client**:
   - Enhanced the axios interceptor to ensure proper auth header formatting
   - Added explicit user ID header to all API requests
   - Made the client compatible with both token storage mechanisms

## Benefits
- All authenticated API requests now work correctly
- Users can view their dashboard, notifications, and subscriptions
- No changes needed to the Netlify redirects configuration
- Solution works for all users without any special test accounts

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Login to the application
2. Verify dashboard loads with user profile
3. Verify notifications load without 401 errors
4. Verify subscriptions load without 401 errors
